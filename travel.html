    <h1>My travels</h1>
    <div>
        <h2>Los Angeles, CA</h2>
        <p> I went to LA during October 2023. I miss LA because I did my undergrad there. The highlight of my trip was visiting The Broad. I've always wanted to see Yayoi Kusama's Infinity Mirror Room but I always had difficulty securing tickets for that exhibition in undergrad. I'm glad I finally had the chance to experience it in person. What surprised me was how each party only had one minute be inside the room. The time is too short! I wish they would give us more time to experience it.</p>

        <h2>Orange County, CA</h2>
        <p> My partner lives in Orange County and I've been visiting the area often. The last time I went was October 2023. I enjoy spending time with my partner and trying different resturants. Two of my favorite meals were the Tom Kha ramen from Kin Izakaya and the Kaisendon from ROL Hand Roll Bar.</p>

        <h2>Seattle, WA</h2>
        <p>I went to Seattle with my partner during summer 2023. We were there for a few days. It was a trip to celebrate me getting into graduate school! Being from the Bay Area, Seattle surprisingly reminded me a lot of San Francisco. It was a fun trip and I would love to return in the future! I had a yummy ube latte with the cutest Sailor Moon latte art; I also got to see the Laika exhibition to get a behind the scenes of one of my favorite movies, Caroline.</p>
